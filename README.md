ðŸš¦ Traffic Accident & Congestion Monitoring BI Dashboard

As part of a data-driven approach to urban mobility and public safety, I developed a comprehensive BI dashboard that visualizes key insights into traffic accidents, congestion patterns, and high-risk zones across city streets and regions.

Built using Power BI and populated with realistic mock data generated in Python (Faker, Pandas), the dashboard tracks essential KPIs such as:

Accident frequency, severity, and location-based trends

Congestion hotspots and peak hour analysis

Violation types and causes (e.g., speeding, poor road conditions)

Combined risk scoring for intersections and road segments

It also provides actionable recommendations for infrastructure improvements and enforcement measures, along with before-and-after visualizations to monitor the impact of interventions.

This project simulates how law enforcement and traffic safety authorities can use BI tools to reduce road accidents, improve traffic flow, and enhance urban planning.
